# 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps

---

## 🚀 What I Learned Today:

- DevOps means combining **Development + Operations** to make software delivery **faster, automated, and reliable**.
- Traditional software development had silos: developers wrote code, operations handled deployment. DevOps **breaks this wall**.
- Core DevOps goals:
  - Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
  - Automation
  - Collaboration
  - Monitoring & Feedback Loops

---

## 📚 Key Concepts:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| CI/CD | Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment |
| SCM  | Source Code Management (like Git) |
| IaC  | Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) |
| Pipeline | Sequence of steps to build/test/deploy software |

---

## 💡 Simple Explanation:

> **DevOps = Shortcut to fast, error-free software delivery.**  
> Like a factory line that builds, tests, and ships code to users automatically.

## 🔍 Tools to Explore (Coming Soon):

- **Git**
- **Linux CLI**
- **AWS EC2**
- **Docker**
- **Jenkins**
- **Ansible / Terraform**

## 🧠 My Thoughts:

I always thought DevOps was only for experts, but today I understood that even with small steps like learning Linux and Git, I’m already entering the DevOps world.

Excited to continue my journey 🚀
