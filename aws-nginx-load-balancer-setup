# AWS NGINX Load Balancer Deployment – Rit Shivali ☁️

This project demonstrates how to deploy **two EC2 instances behind an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with **NGINX web servers** running on each instance.

## 🚀 What I Built

✅ 2 EC2 Ubuntu instances  
✅ NGINX installed on both with custom HTML page  
✅ Application Load Balancer forwarding traffic to both  
✅ Target group health check path: `/`  
✅ Traffic automatically balances between both instances

## ⚙️ Steps I Followed

### 🔹 Step 1: Launch 2 EC2 Instances
- Ubuntu 22.04, t2.micro (Free Tier)

- User data used:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt update
apt install nginx -y
echo "<h1>Hello from Rit EC2-1</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl start nginx

epeat for EC2-2 with: Hello from Rit EC2-2

🔹 Step 2: Configure Target Group
Type: Instance

Protocol: HTTP

Port: 80

Health check path: /

Registered both EC2s

✅ Status: Healthy

🔹 Step 3: Create Application Load Balancer
Type: Application (ALB)

Scheme: Internet-facing
