# AWS IAM Practice – Rit Shivali ☁️🔐

This repository documents my hands-on practice and learning of **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** in AWS. IAM is the foundation of AWS security and allows fine-grained access control to AWS resources.

---

## 🔐 What I Practiced

- ✅ Creating IAM users with programmatic and console access
- ✅ Grouping users and assigning policies (e.g., Admin, S3ReadOnly)
- ✅ Creating custom IAM policies using JSON
- ✅ Using IAM roles with EC2 to access other services securely
- ✅ Enabling and testing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- ✅ Understanding IAM best practices (least privilege, no root usage)

---

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **IAM Users** | Individual accounts to access AWS |
| **IAM Groups** | Logical grouping of users to manage permissions easily |
| **IAM Policies** | JSON documents that define allowed or denied actions |
| **IAM Roles** | Assign temporary access to services like EC2, Lambda |
| **MFA** | Adds security by requiring an additional auth factor |
| **Best Practices** | Avoid root usage, use least privilege, rotate keys, etc. |
