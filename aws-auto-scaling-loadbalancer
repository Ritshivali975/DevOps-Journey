# AWS Auto Scaling with Load Balancer – Rit Shivali ☁️

This project demonstrates how to set up **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** on AWS using EC2 and NGINX. When demand increases, new instances launch automatically — and when load decreases, instances terminate.

- ✅ Target Group for health check routing  
- ✅ Application Load Balancer (ALB)  
- ✅ Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with min, max, desired instance setup  
- ✅ Manual scaling and self-healing behavior tested
